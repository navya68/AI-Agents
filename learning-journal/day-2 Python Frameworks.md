## What are Python Frameworks and why are they needed

An AI agent is like a “person” that can:

- Think using an LLM (like ChatGPT, Claude, Llama, etc.)

- Take actions using tools (APIs, search, code execution, databases)

- Remember things using memory modules

- Plan its steps until the task is complete

**So an agent = LLM brain + tools + memory + decision system.**

Example:
“Book me the cheapest flight to Delhi, then email me the ticket.”

A normal chatbot can’t do that.
An AI agent can:

- Think → understand the task

- Use a tool → call a flight API

- Use another tool → send an email

- Decide → confirm when done
