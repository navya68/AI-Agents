## What are Python Frameworks and why are they needed

An AI agent is like a “person” that can:

- Think using an LLM (like ChatGPT, Claude, Llama, etc.)

- Take actions using tools (APIs, search, code execution, databases)

- Remember things using memory modules

- Plan its steps until the task is complete

**So an agent = LLM brain + tools + memory + decision system.**

Example:
“Book me the cheapest flight to Delhi, then email me the ticket.”

A normal chatbot can’t do that.
An AI agent can:

- Think → understand the task

- Use a tool → call a flight API

- Use another tool → send an email

- Decide → confirm when done

**Just like a house needs invisible pipes behind the walls, an AI agent needs invisible “pipes” to connect LLM → memory → tools → control logic.**
**Frameworks build these pipes for you.**

AI agent : 

A smart assistant that uses LLM + tools to do tasks.

To be more specific:

**A framework has a predefined structure (code + flow) and built-in tools (functions/methods) that make building AI applications easier.**

**This means we don’t need to write the entire code for basic AI tasks such as data handling, model training, evaluation, or inference.
These functionalities are already implemented inside the framework, and we can directly use them by calling the provided classes and methods.**

 **Based on different requirements, we choose different frameworks.**

 - Easy & quick development → Keras
   
 - More control & flexibility → PyTorch
   
 - Large-scale production systems → TensorFlow
   
 - LLM apps & AI agents → LangChain
   
 - Using ready pre-trained models → Hugging Face
   
 - Managed AI without training → AWS Bedrock
